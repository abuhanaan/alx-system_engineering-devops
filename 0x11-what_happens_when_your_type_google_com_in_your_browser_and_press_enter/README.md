## Background Context

- Being a Full-Stack Software Engineer means one is comfortable interacting with any layer of the stack.
- A way to easily assess this is to simply ask an engineer to explain how a software system works. They can have a general overview of the flow or can choose to dig deep in a certain area.
- This task is tailored upon exploring the infrastructure side (network, servers, securityâ€¦etc) of the question.
